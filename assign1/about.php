    <h2>Assignment 2: System development project 1</h2>

    <p>My responses to the questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>PHP Version Installed: </strong><?php echo phpversion(); ?></li>
        <li><strong>Tasks Attempted/Skipped: </strong>All tasks attempted, no tasks deliberately skipped</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Special Features: </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Modular navbar, stored in a single file accessible</li>
                <li>Small JavaScript script that changes the underlined item in navbar based on file name</li>
                <li>Moderate CSS styling, including custom buttons, shading in tables, bolding/text styling, consideration around element padding/alignment</li>
                <li>Implemented two layer validation - client side in form, and validation on processing page</li>
                <li>Small JavaScript script that ensures one of the checkboxes is checked during Job Position creation, toggling the <em>required</em> attribute in the DOM when checked/unchecked</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I did not participate in any discussion points for Assignment 2 for two main reasons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I was extremely busy over the past 2 weeks with work and personal matters - lots of overtime and when not at work trying to spend as much time with my father who is quite unwell currently</li>
        <li>I did not feel like I needed the support from my peers, as I am fairly confident in my ability to complete the assignment based on existing knowledge/experience</li>
    </ol>
